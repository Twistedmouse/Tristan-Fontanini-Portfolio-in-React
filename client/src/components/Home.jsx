              I am a forever learning full stack developer who focuses more on
              the front end side. I really enjoy design and creating interesting
              UI/UX design where it fits. I have mostly worked with Html, CSS,
              Javascript, ReactJS and C#. Currently I am learning VR
              development, game dev and learning about machine learning and how
              I can make it work with gaming. Most of my experience is around
              web development and finding automated solutions. I get excited
              learning new things and plan to continue growing on my coding
              journey.
